2. On your computer create a folder, the folder should be the full name of the game with one "-" (Dash) between each word (no letters capitalized).
3. In the folder upload the games "index.html" file to the folder (if the games html file isnt named index rename it).
4. Rename the games image to "icon" then upload it to the folder you created (make sure it has the .jpg file extension if it doesnt use an online converter)
5. Create a fork of this repository
6. Upload your folder to github (drag and drop the folder on the upload file page)
7. Go into your repository settings then click on "pages" and select "deploy from branch"
